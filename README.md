## What this plugin does better?

There are so many slider plugins out there. But if you care about performance and user experience, you'll probably like this slider. Here is why this implementation of [Slick Carousel](http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/) is different from others:

* Performance Optimization:
	* Serve scaled images: The plugin forces you to specify the size of your images, so that they will be resized accordingly.
	* Specify image dimensions: Many slider plugins out there forget about the `width` and `height`.
	* Ability to Lazy Load images: You can easy lazy load the images of your slider to reduce the page load time.
	* Ability to use CDN: You can enable Cloudinary to take advantage of their CDN network and image optimizations
* Simply User Interface:
	* Do everything from a single screen. Unlike other slider plugins, this plugin is very simple to use. You will never have to create each slide individually, then upload an image, click Update, etc. Everything is shown on a single page.
